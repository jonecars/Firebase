# Overview
My program is an inventory manager that runs in the terminal.  It connects with a cloud firebase database.  
You are then able to add products and manage their information.

I wrote this software so that I could learn how to use cloud databases in my future python projects.

# Cloud Database
Made using cloud firebase from google.
I am using one collection (inventory) with each document being a product.  Each document has more information about the product.

# Development Environment
I used visual studio code with python 3.9.13. 
Firebase_admin library was used to interact with the database.

# Future Work
* Add more information and menu options for each product.
* Make all product names upper or lowercase.
* Add a better interface.
